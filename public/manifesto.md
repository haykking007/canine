# Why does Canine exist?

As a cofounder of a previous start up, I saw first hand how the cost of hosting a web app could explode over time.

What I found weird was that costs grew with organizational complexity, not compute complexity, and often in area's I never expected.

As it turns out, the cost you pay to host <b>your app</b> is only a fraction of the total IT spend.

I'll walk through the history of our IT spend and see how it grew over time.

### At Launch
| Service | Spend (monthly) |
| -------- | ------- |
| Heroku | $100 |
| Google Maps | $50 |
| Sentry | FREE |
| Looker | $1000 |
| Redshift | $800 |
| FiveTran | $600 |
| **TOTAL** | **$2950** |

Interesting to note, the cost of hosting our app (Heroku) was a tiny portion of our IT spend.

By year 1, we had grown our team (40+), and added a few more tools to our tech stack.
